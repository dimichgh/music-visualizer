- Install core dependencies (Electron, React, etc.)
- Configure build scripts
- Create basic Electron main process file
- Status: ✅ Completed

### 3. Create Main Window Configuration
- Set up Electron BrowserWindow
- Configure window properties
- Create IPC communication between main and renderer
- Status: ✅ Completed

### 4. Implement Basic UI Shell
- Create React application structure
- Implement basic layouts
- Create initial components
- Status: ✅ Completed

### 5. Implement System Audio Capture
- Research macOS audio capture options
- Implement audio device selection
- Set up audio stream capture
- Create audio buffer management
- Status: ✅ Completed (initial implementation with Web Audio API)

### 6. Establish Audio Analysis Pipeline

- Create frequency data extraction
- Implement beat detection
- Status: ✅ Completed

## Implementation Details

### Audio Capture Options
- Primary: Implemented a solution using Web Audio API for audio analysis
- Note: For actual system audio capture, native modules would be required in a production version.
  We've implemented a simulated approach for development.

### UI Framework Setup
- Implemented React for component-based UI
- Created CSS modules for styling
- Implemented responsive layout for controls and visualization area

### Visualization Themes
- Cosmic: Space-themed visualization with stars and particles
- Weather: Weather-themed visualization with clouds, rain and lightning
- Night Sky: Night sky with stars, moon, and northern lights
- Concert: Concert-themed visualization with crowd and instruments

## Current Status
Phase 1 has been completed. The application can be run in development mode with `npm run dev`.

## Next Steps (For Phase 2)
1. Implement more advanced audio analysis techniques
2. Optimize CPU rendering performance
3. Add more detailed visualization elements
4. Improve user controls and interaction
5. Implement persistence for user settings
